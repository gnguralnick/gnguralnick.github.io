    Ever since I was young, I've always been incredibly interested in technology.
    I grew up seeing the development of all kinds of 'magical' new tools, and I'm excited to now be a part of their creation.
    I'm also immensely curious about the workings of the human mind and believe one of the best ways to better understand it is through trying to replicate it.
    My studies in cognitive science and computer science have given me the tools to do just that.
